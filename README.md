===============

Repo for blog posts. Try and keep the entries to the markdown format so we can format them in a common manner. 
If everyone's able to stick to GitHub-flavored MarkDown we should be alright.

Organization
------------

Each subfolder of the main directory has an index file for you to explicitly record the order of the posts, approval date by the department senior and publication date. See Front End for more details on syntax.

Workflow
--------

1. Branch master - if we need more granularity we can have separate branches for approved and in-progress posts
2. Rebase / merge with master and push back up
3. Don't push back to master until your article is ready to publish
