Leading from the Front
======================

The idea of planning a 'Front End' project is as nebulous as it is new. This
article explores the processes I developed in designing Backbone_Bootstrap as a
model for application development.

* Cost savings in moving application processing logic to the browser and the
benefits of open data models
* Still decide on scope, requirements
* Once you decide on an appropriate tech stack, define the API
* Write unit tests around this interface
* Common hang-up of backend developers holding up the front end is removed
* Encourages better software development by coding to an interface
* Locus of planning effort is on defining JSON entities
* Front-End can then use mocking frameworks to emulate back-end
* Unit Test coverage is doubled up - good thing for testing code coverage and
verifying tests are being run correctly
* 3 core efforts are then in parallel: design, front end, back end.
* Project specification then focuses only on the design that is necessary for
teams to work together and allows parties with strengths to make design
decisions in their partiular area of expertise.
* Integration testing is less painful
